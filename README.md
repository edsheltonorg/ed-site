# ed-wiki
My public site's source code.

This is currently under construction as I investigate tooling.

The site will be in some form of blog.

# What're the topics?

I intend to use the site to publish:

- IT analysis & decision crafting
- Holistic programming and administration guides
- Journalistic articles relating to IT & IT happenings
- Companion pieces to larger projects
